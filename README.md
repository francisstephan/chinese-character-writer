# CHINESE CHARACTER WRITER
This program will assist in getting characters (汉字) from their pinyin (拼音) or reverse.
It is based on a small dictionary, but it is no substitute for a regular character dictionary such as the 新华字典.

The dictionary part is a read-only sqlite3 database.

The server is written in go as a direct example of my  gin-html-tutorial (https://github.com/francisstephan/gin-html-tutorial).

The browser pages are rendered on the server side.
